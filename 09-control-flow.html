<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Write conditional statements with <code>if</code> and <code>else</code>.</li>
<li>Correctly evaluate expressions containing <code>&amp;</code> (&quot;and&quot;) and <code>|</code> (&quot;or&quot;).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Often when we're coding we want to control the flow of our actions. Control flow (or flow of control) is simply the order in which we code and have our statements evaluated. That can be done by setting things to happen only if a condition or a set of conditions are met. Alternatively, we can also set an action to be computed for a particular number of times.</p>
<p>There are many ways these can be achieved in R. For conditional statements, the most commonly used approaches are the constructs:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">if (and else)
while</code></pre>
<p>Say, for example, that we want R to print a message depending on how a number x relates to 5:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">set.seed</span>(<span class="dv">10</span>)
x &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">rpois</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dt">lambda=</span><span class="dv">8</span>)
if (x &gt;=<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">10</span>) {
    <span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;x is greater than or equals 10&quot;</span>)
} else if (x &gt;<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">5</span>) {
    <span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;x is greater than 5&quot;</span>)
} else {
    <span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;x is smaller than 5&quot;</span>)
}</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>[1] &quot;x is greater or equal than 5&quot;</code></pre>
<div id="tip-psuedo-random-numbers" class="callout">
<h4>Tip: psuedo-random numbers</h4>
<p>In the above case, the function <code>rpois</code> generates a random number following a Poisson distribution with a mean (i.e. lambda) of 8. The function <code>set.seed</code> guarantees that all machines that use the seed 10 as an input, will generate the exact same 'pseudo-random' number (<a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/R_Programming/Random_Number_Generation">more about pseudo-random numbers</a>). Now, looking at at x we see that it takes the value 8 (you should get the exact same number).</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> when R evaluates the condition inside <code>if</code> statements, it is looking for a logical element, i.e., <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code>. This can cause some headache for beginners. For example:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">x  &lt;-<span class="st">  </span><span class="dv">4</span> ==<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">3</span>
if (x) {
    <span class="st">&quot;4 equals 3&quot;</span>
}</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, the message was not printed because the vector x is <code>FALSE</code></p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">x  &lt;-<span class="st">  </span><span class="dv">4</span> ==<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">3</span>
x</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>[1] FALSE</code></pre>
<p>Also, be careful if you a vector with more than one logical elements, the function <code>if</code> will still run, but will only evaluate the condition of first element</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">set.seed</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>)
x  &lt;-<span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">round</span>(<span class="kw">rnorm</span>(<span class="dv">30</span>, <span class="dt">mean=</span><span class="dv">15</span>, <span class="dt">sd=</span><span class="dv">15</span>))
y  &lt;-<span class="st">  </span>x %in%<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">16</span>)

if(y) {
  <span class="kw">stop</span>(<span class="st">&#39;at least one number in x was found within the sequence c(3, 5, 16)&#39;</span>)
}</code></pre>
<p>You can see that R does not return any result but instead prints a warning message.</p>
<pre class="output"><code>Warning message:
In if (y) { :
  the condition has length &gt; 1 and only the first element will be used</code></pre>
<p>The reason for that is because the first element in <code>y</code>, <code>y[1]</code> is <code>FALSE</code> (i.e. <code>x[1]</code> is 6 and therefore is not contained within <code>c(3, 5, 16)</code>), so the action within the condition is not evaluated. Such cases where multiple comparisons/logical statements are contained within one single vector are not uncommon, and I suspect you are probably looking for the functions <code>any</code> or <code>all</code> before running an <code>if</code> statement. <code>any</code> will return TRUE if at least one TRUE value is found within a vector, otherwise will return <code>FALSE</code>. The function <code>all</code>, as the name suggests, will only return <code>TRUE</code> if all values in the vector are <code>TRUE</code>. We can build on the above example to make this clear - suppose that we want to make sure that we avoid the warning message, and, on top of that, print a more informative message:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">if(<span class="kw">any</span>(y)) {
  <span class="kw">stop</span>(<span class="kw">paste0</span>(<span class="kw">paste0</span>(x[y], <span class="dt">collapse=</span><span class="st">&#39; and &#39;</span>), <span class="st">&#39; found in x&#39;</span>))
}</code></pre>
<p>Notice that now returns an Error message</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">Error:<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">3</span> and <span class="dv">16</span> found in x</code></pre>
<p>The reason for that is because the function <code>stop</code> was evaluated. This function is widely used in what's known as <em>defensive programming</em> - if you anticipate a potential problem in your data manipulation/analysis within a function, the function can stop if this certain problem occurs and print an informative error message. The same idea works for the function <code>warning</code>. We could have also created the different statements with the function <code>all</code> instead of <code>any</code>. Try that by yourself.</p>
<h3 id="repeating-operations">Repeating operations</h3>
<p>Just as we saw in the shell lessons earlier, you can repeat operations in <code>R</code> using <code>for</code> loops. It is the most flexible of looping operations, but therefore also the hardest to use correctly. For loops should be avoided unless the order of iteration is important: i.e. the calcaulation at each iteration depends on the results of the previous.</p>
<p>When the order of iteration <strong>is</strong> important, we can use loops. The basic structure of a <code>for</code> loop is:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">for(iterator in set of values){
  do a thing
}</code></pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">for(i in <span class="dv">1</span>:<span class="dv">10</span>){
  <span class="kw">print</span>(i)
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>1:10</code> bit is basically just creating a vector on the fly; you can iterate over any other vector as well.</p>
<p>We can use a for loop within another for loop to iterate over two things at once (e.g., rows and columns of a matrix).</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">for(i in <span class="dv">1</span>:<span class="dv">5</span>){
  for(j in <span class="dv">1</span>:<span class="dv">5</span>){
    <span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="kw">paste</span>(i,j))
  }
}</code></pre>
<div id="tip-dont-grow-your-results" class="callout">
<h4>Tip: don't grow your results</h4>
<p>One of the biggest things that trips up novices and even experienced R users alike, is building a results object (vector, list, matrix, data frame) as your for loop progresses. Computers are very bad at handling this, so your calculations can very quickly slow to a crawl. It's much better to define an empty results object before hand of the appropriate dimensions. So if you know the end result will be stored in a matrix like above, create an empty matrix with 5 row and 5 columns, then at each iteration store the results in the appropriate location.</p>
</div>
<p>Sometimes you will find yourself needing to repeat an operation until a certain condition is met, rather than doing it for a specific number of times. In some cases you might be able to hack something together using a <code>for</code> loop, but usually you'd be much better off using a <code>while</code> loop instead. <code>While</code> loops look and act a lot like <code>for</code> loops, but instead of saying:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">for(iterator in set of values){
  do a thing
}</code></pre>
<p>You instead say:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">while(this condition is true){
  do a thing
} </code></pre>
<p>Let's try an example, shall we? We'll try to come up with some simple code that generates random numbers between 0 and 1 until it gets one that's less than 0.1.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">while(z &gt;<span class="st"> </span><span class="fl">0.1</span>){
  z &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">runif</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>)
  <span class="kw">print</span>(z)
}</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>Error: object &#39;z&#39; not found</code></pre>
<p>But wait, that doesn't work! What's the problem?</p>
<p>The problem is that we haven't defined <code>z</code>, and so the very first time the while loop's condition is checked (<code>z &gt; 0.1</code>), <code>while</code> just says &quot;Okay, that's not true so I'm not going to execute this block of code&quot;. The same thing would have happened if we defined <code>z</code> to be anything less than 0.1. Let's fix it.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">z &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">1</span>
while(z &gt;<span class="st"> </span><span class="fl">0.1</span>){
  z &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">runif</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>)
  <span class="kw">print</span>(z)
}</code></pre>
<div id="challenge-1" class="challenge">
<h4>Challenge 1</h4>
<p>Write a script that loops through each continent and prints out whether the mean life expectancy is smaller or larger than 50 years.</p>
</div>
<div id="challenge-2" class="challenge">
<h4>Challenge 2</h4>
<p>Modify the script from challenge 1 to also loop over each country. This time print out whether the life expectancy is smaller than 50, between 50 and 70, or greater than 70.</p>
